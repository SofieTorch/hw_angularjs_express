# AngularJS with Express simple example

## About
This is just another little homework for the university, using AngularJS for the frontend (with the cdn) and Express for the backend. It isn't linked to a database, so all the registers you'll put will dissapear if you stop the server while it's running.

Don't expect too much, I'm learning :)

## How to run this project
* Clone this repo and go to the path in your terminal (you'll need nodejs installed)  
* Then, run `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies for the project.
* Finally, run `npm run dev` and open you browser in **localhost, port 3000**.  
    * You can also run `nodemon server/main.js` or `node server/main.js` if you prefer.
